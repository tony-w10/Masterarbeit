Citadel is also the firm that has been [funding Melvin capital ]( firm who started the shorts in the first place) in the last few days, in the billions, to help them cover shorts. Yesterday rumors started that Melvin was continuing to buy more shorts, I knew they were about to change the rules. Both firms stand to lose a lot of money from this, or walk out with one of the most brazen robberies in history. Best part? The founder of Melvin capital, [Gabe Plotkin]( worked for Citadel when he founded Melvin. (Fun fact, Plotkin was just in the news last month for buying two new homes in Miami Beach for $45 million!) They are about to rob the American people of billions and have been colluding in the highest level and blatant market manipulation. They figured they’ll pay a few million in fines, if that, and make billions off of the people. Fuck Gabe Plotkin, Melvin capital, Citadel, and Robinhood."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "-1 | 0 | 0"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Comment: Fidelity still letting me buy.
